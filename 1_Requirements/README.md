# Wiper Control System

## Introduction

A windscreen wiper or windshield wiper is a device used to remove rain, snow, ice and debris from a windscreen or windshield . almost all motor vehicles, including cars , trucks, train locomotives, watercraft with a cabin and some aircraft, are equipped with such wipers, which are usually a legal requirement. A wiper generally consists of a metal arm, pivoting at one end and with a long rubber blade attached to the other. The arm is powered by a motor, often an electric motor, although pneumatic power is also used in some vehicles. The blade is swung back and forth over the glass, pushing water or the other precipitation from its surface. The speed is normally adjustable, with several continuous speeds and often one or more “intermittent” settings. Most automobiles use two synchronized radial type arms, while many commercial vehicles use one or more paragraph arms.
Wipers may be powered by a variety of means, although most in use today are powered by an electric motor through a series of mechanical components, typically two 4-bar linkages in series or parallel.
