# Wiper Control System

## Introduction

A windscreen wiper or windshield wiper is a device used to remove rain, snow, ice and debris from a windscreen or windshield . almost all motor vehicles, including cars , trucks, train locomotives, watercraft with a cabin and some aircraft, are equipped with such wipers, which are usually a legal requirement. A wiper generally consists of a metal arm, pivoting at one end and with a long rubber blade attached to the other. The arm is powered by a motor, often an electric motor, although pneumatic power is also used in some vehicles. The blade is swung back and forth over the glass, pushing water or the other precipitation from its surface. The speed is normally adjustable, with several continuous speeds and often one or more “intermittent” settings. Most automobiles use two synchronized radial type arms, while many commercial vehicles use one or more paragraph arms.
Wipers may be powered by a variety of means, although most in use today are powered by an electric motor through a series of mechanical components, typically two 4-bar linkages in series or parallel.
So here we propose an automatic wiper system that automatically switches ON on detecting rain and stops when rain stops. Our project brings forward this system to automate the wiper system having no need for manual intervention Our system uses rain sensor to detect rain, this signal is then processed by arduino and take the desired action. The rain sensor works on the principle of using water for completing its circuit, so when rain falls on it it’s circuit gets completed and sends out a signal to arduino and drive the motor to simulate car wiper action. systems become an even more appealing feature, as they work to minimize the time the driver must take his/her hands off the wheel. These systems detect droplets of rain on the windshield and automatically turn on and adjust the wiper system in accordance to the level of precipitation. Current rain-sensing systems use an optical sensor to detect the presence of water on the windshield, and relay wiper control data to the vehicle's body control module (BCM). Unfortunately, these optical rain sensors suffer from a small sensing area, are prone to false-3 positives, and are too expensive to be included as standard equipment in most vehicles.Over the past two decades, the automotive industry has aggressively researched ways to exploit modern computing and electronic advances in the development of safety, reliability, and entertainment technologies. Despite this, automatic rain-sensing wiper systems are relatively uncommon in modern vehicles for a number of reasons. They are often too expensive, too unsightly, or too unreliable to be desired in new automobiles. Many attempts have been made at constructing an effective, reliable, and cheap rain detection and wiper control system for vehicles speed and intermittent interval automatically according to the amount of rain. To measure the amount of water usually use optical sensor. In this type of sensors uses the fact that the refraction angle and the amount of reflection of the light are different when the 2 windshield is wet. Even though optical sensors are used widely they have some disadvantage. One of disadvantages is the sensitivity to external light. Another problem is occurs when car drive at night or gone through tunnel and even in underground parking. For this many systems still activate the wiper when the car comes out of tunnels or underground parking lot. Another shortfall, maybe a major one is that the sensing area is a relatively small portion of windshield. Hence the system operates only with limited area.
